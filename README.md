# Assessment
For the first question I have coded using tensorflow in Google Colab. I couldnt export the code from colab to Github. So I have attached the link to the google colab below.

I have used CNN for image classifictaion and identification since they produce better prediction results than other machine learning algorithms like SVM.
I have two sets of images which have also been uploaded. One set consists of human images and the other set consists of things. The data is split into training and test. Using hold one out cross validation. 

For the second question, neutral colours are removed after which the dominant colour is found.
